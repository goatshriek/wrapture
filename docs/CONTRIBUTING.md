## Help Wrapture Do Better, Suck Less
Wrapture is a small project that aims to do something small very well while
staying as simple as possible. If you've got a problem with the project, you
have a great idea for a new feature, or you just want to find a way to
contribute, then check out the guidelines below on how to get started. Also,
please make sure that you adhere to the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
however you participate.


### **It broke**
If you've got a problem with the project, please make sure that you've done the
following things before submitting an issue:

 * Review the documentation to ensure that the behavior is unintentional
 * Search through the other issues on the project to ensure that this is not
   already captured
 * Replicate the problem from the master branch

If you've completed all of these steps and the problem persists, submit an
issue on the [GitHub project](https://github.com/goatshriek/wrapture) using
the provided issue template with all information filled in.

Even better, if you know how to fix the issue go ahead an submit a pull request
using the provided template, mentioning the corresponding issue number.


### **I'm helping!**
Made some changes and want to share your work? Great! Submit a pull request and
we'll review it for inclusion into the master branch. Make sure that you follow
these guidelines:
 * Include a `Signed-off-by` tag in all of your commits (using the `-s` option
   of `git commit`).
 * Keep the number of commits in your request to a minimum. Having multiple
   commits is fine if necessary to separate multiple changes, but make sure
   that these are logical and value to the commit history.
 * If a commit resolves or is otherwise related to a particular issue, include
   a reference to it in the body of the commit.


### **It would be great if...**
If you have a new feature that you think would be worthwhile, feel free to send
an email to the project owner at joelanderson333@gmail.com with your idea. If it
fits with the project then you can begin working on a fork of the project and
submit a pull request of your branch so that we can watch it progress and merge
it in once it is complete.


### **I don't know where to start**
If you'd like to contribute but aren't quite sure where to start, take a look
at the issues and see if there is anything there that you think you can tackle!
In particular, the help wanted and good first issue labels mark issues that need
attention and are relatively simple to fix, respectively.


### You still there?
The project team aims to be as responsive as we can, typically responding to
new issues and pull requests within a few days. Asking for clarification on an
issue or requesting changes to a pull request is fairly common, and often some
back and forth is needed before something can be accepted.

Unfortunately, sometimes these conversations stall and no progress is made. In
cases where this happens and the project team is waiting for a response, the
item will eventually be closed as stale. Items that have had no response for
two months will be labeled as stale, and a warning will be posted in the
discussion. If another month passes with no response, then the item will be
closed as stale.

Stale items can always be reopened, so don't feel like the discussion is over
forever if something gets closed! We just want to keep our active work nice
and tidy for everyone to quickly see what we're working (and what we aren't).


## Thanks
And no matter how you contribute, thanks for giving back to the community!
