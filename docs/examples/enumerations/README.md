# Enumeration Example

Enumerations are a common tool in many languages to define a known set of values
for use in a library. While these do exist in C code already, the mechanics are
slightly different depending on the target language.

```yaml
enums:
  - name: "Fruit"
    elements:
      - name: "apple"
      - name: "banana"
      - name: "grape"
      - name: "orange"
```
