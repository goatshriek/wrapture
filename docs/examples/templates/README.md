# Template Example

As with any programming exercise, eventually you will encounter the need to do
something repetitive. There are a lot of opportunities for this situation to
arise in Wrapture specs: classes that wrap enumerations, identical error
handling code in a library, or functions with very similar specifications.
Wrapture provides a generalized capability to avoid repeating yourself called
templates, which allow you to define any spec structure and define variables
within them that can be replaced when they are invoked.

For this example, we'll consider a fictional library that is able to answer just
about any mathematical question you ask it. We want to extend this functionality
so that it feels a little more natural in the target language.

```yaml

```
