# Wrapture Examples

These examples show how to use Wrapture to create language bindings for various
use cases. If you aren't sure exactly where to start, the basic example is a
good place.

Each example has a README that walks through the details of the configuration in
detail, in addition to the .yml configuration itself. Some simple C code is
included for the example to wrap, as well as some code in the output language
that demonstrates use of the binding.
