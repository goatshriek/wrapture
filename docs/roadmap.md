# The Future of Wrapture

Wrapture is under active development, and has a long list of new features and improvements waiting to be made. Some of these are detailed in the issues list on the project Github repository, but this is certainly not a comprehensive list of planned updates.

## A Note about Github issues and projects

A fair question to ask is why the roadmap is not being managed within the issue and project features of Github itself, since this is where the project is currently hosted. Indeed, suggestions submitted by the community are tracked as issues, and projects are already created for ongoing work. There are a few reasons that a separate roadmap is maintained:
 * **Issues are used to exclusively track bugs and community requests.**
   This certainly isn't a hard and fast rule, and isn't followed by many other projects, but it is how Wrapture is managed. Keeping the issue count as a clear indicator of problems and community requests lets the project maintainers (and anyone interested in looking at how well it is being maintained) immediately see how much outstanding work exists. Of course, the roadmap may have features requested by the community or enhancements made clear by bug reports, but it will also have a number of features and tweaks that have a lower priority.
 * **Project direction should come packaged with the product.**
   Again this isn't commonly followed rule, but it is one that the project author believes in. Anyone that obtains the source code of the project at a single point in time should be able to quickly see the current direction of the project. Maintaining the roadmap within the version control of the source itself facilitates this, the same way that licensing and copyright notifications are also bundled with the code.
