# The Future of Wrapture

Wrapture is under active development, and has a long list of new features and improvements waiting to be made. Some of these are detailed in the issues list on the project Github repository, but this is certainly not a comprehensive list of planned updates. Similarly, work that is in progress on new features is tracked as a project on the Github repository, but future planned work does not exist there either. Instead, the plans for future direction of the library is kept here, in the project roadmap.

Items are added to the roadmap once they have been identified, assessed for level of effort, and prioritized based on community needs. Each item is assigned to a semantic version where it is expected to be included, along with a description of what the change will be and why it is needed. Where they exist, you will see references to issues on the Github repository where you can go for more details on the origin of the request. Once a version is in work, you will be able to find a corresponding project on the Github repository with each roadmap item listed as a task. Once all tasks are complete, the version will be released and the next version started.

Once an item has been implemented it will be removed from the roadmap. If you would like to see a history of changes on the existing codebase, check out the ChangeLog (ChangeLog.md in the project root) to see what was included in each version of the library.

Note that there are either vague or no timelines associated with each change. The project team is currently not big enough to meet any timeline promises realistically, and so timing is left vague in order to prevent users from feeling cheated if something takes longer than expected to make it into a version.

## A Note about Github issues and projects

A fair question to ask is why the roadmap is not being managed within the issue and project features of Github itself, since this is where the project is currently hosted. Indeed, suggestions submitted by the community are tracked as issues, and projects are already created for ongoing work. There are a few reasons that a separate roadmap is maintained:
 * **Issues are used to exclusively track bugs and community requests.**
   This certainly isn't a hard and fast rule, and isn't followed by many other projects, but it is how Wrapture is managed. Keeping the issue count as a clear indicator of problems and community requests lets the project maintainers (and anyone interested in looking at how well it is being maintained) immediately see how much outstanding work exists. Of course, the roadmap may have features requested by the community or enhancements made clear by bug reports, but it will also have a number of features and tweaks that have a lower priority.
 * **Project direction should come packaged with the product.**
   Again this isn't commonly followed rule, but it is one that the project author believes in. Anyone that obtains the source code of the project at a single point in time should be able to quickly see the current direction of the project. Maintaining the roadmap within the version control of the source itself facilitates this, the same way that licensing and copyright notifications are also bundled with the code.
